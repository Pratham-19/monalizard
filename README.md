MonaLizard redefines Web3 marketing by transforming user engagement from mere rewards to a community-driven experience. Its NFT puzzle game and chatrooms foster lasting connections and real-time interaction, transcending traditional reward systems.

# Project Description
Current Web3 marketing tools are great at onboarding new users but fall short on retention, once the rewards are claimed engagement is over, leaving a void in community connection, and having the participant’s name on a list or scoreboard is not enough to feel part of a community.

Monalizard revolutionizes Web3 marketing aiming to create stronger interactions for both new and seasoned dApps users by gamifying interactions and building stronger communities. Through an engaging NFT puzzle game, Monalizard keeps the conversation alive and buzzing, word of mouth has always been king, isn’t it?

Monalizard recognizes diverse interests among users, they might want also to participate in different puzzles, a marketplace to trade pieces will be available for them to trade pieces in order to complete different puzzles, and also all chatrooms will be open for users to propose deals on puzzle pieces. After all, it is all about converting users to crypto degens!
